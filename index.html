      <h3>Un-British things:</h3>
      <dl>
	<dt><img src="img/2-small.png">Europe</dt>
	<dd>UKIP believes that Britain is still a global superpower that can do better on its own. <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eight-out-of-10-businesses-would-vote-for-britain-to-remain-in-the-eu-according-to-poll-8810299.html">8 out of 10 business owners disagree</a>.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/4-small.png">Immigrants</dt>
	<dd>Coming over here, stealing our jobs and our benefits! Except <a href="http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/jameskirkup/100221789/immigration-and-the-british-economy-the-awful-truth-is-revealed/">the evidence says immigration is good for the economy</a>. And let's not forget that free migration is also good for the <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/eight-out-of-10-businesses-would-vote-for-britain-to-remain-in-the-eu-according-to-poll-8810299.html">1.8 million Britons living elsewhere in the EU.</a></dd>
	<dt><img src="img/8-small.png">Same-sex couples</dt>
	<dd>UKIP is <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10728807/Nigel-Farage-on-gay-marriage-I-think-we-are-opening-a-very-big-can-of-worms-here.html">very unclear with its position on same-sex marriage</a>, having previously opposed it. A ban on same-sex marriages would enforce an "us and them" mentality by forcing same-sex couples to have a different legal status. And we needn't mention <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-25793358">the "gay floods" incident</a>.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/16-small.png">Women</dt>
	<dd>UKIP continues to <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/womens-politics/10584446/Nigel-Farage-why-is-it-everytime-Ukip-speaks-about-women-they-end-up-trolling-them.html">iterate that women of child-bearing age are "worth less" to employers</a>. A UKIP government would no doubt allow employers to favour male staff purely for being male.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/32-small.png">The environment</dt>
	<dd><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-22396690">UKIP is skeptical of climate change</a>, despite <a href="http://climate.nasa.gov/evidence">overwhelming evidence</a>, and would drop all renewable energy programmes to mine fossil fuels in the UK.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/64-small.png">Equality</dt>
	<dd><a href="http://www.ukip.org/issues" rel="nofollow">UKIP opposes political correctness</a>, which is another way of saying they oppose equality measures. A UKIP government would have no problems abolishing disability, gender, sexual orientation and other equality protections for commercial businesses and employers.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/128-small.png">The world</dt>
	<dd>UKIP genuinely believes that <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/ukip/10622081/Flooding-crisis-suspend-foreign-aid-and-divert-cash-to-floods-demands-Ukip.html">British people are more worthy of aid than other human beings elsewhere</a>, despite Britain having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_GDP_(nominal)_per_capita">more wealth per person than 87% of countries in the world</a>.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/256-small.png">Peace</dt>
	<dd>UKIP wants to <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/mar/07/ukip-policies-manifesto-commitments">dramatically increase our military budget</a>, including purchasing <em>three</em> new aircraft carriers.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/512-small.png">Human rights</dt>
	<dd>A UKIP government would <a href="http://www.ukip.org/issues" rel="nofollow">remove us from the European Convention on Human Rights</a>. After that point the government will be answerable to no one and can introduce any laws they like, from reinstating the death penalty to criminalizing opposition to UKIP policy.</dd>
	<dt><img src="img/1024-small.png">UKIP politicians</dt>
	<dd><a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-25802437">Any</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lincolnshire-24040449">UKIP</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-somerset-22349676">politician</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-sussex-22303637">who</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leicestershire-22330466">says</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-20773800">anything</a> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-24180861">controversial</a> is quickly evicted from the party.
